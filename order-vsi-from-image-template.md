# Ordering an instance from an image template
{: #ordering-an-instance-from-an-image-template}

On the **Image templates** page, you can provision a virtual server instance from an image template. If the operating system of the image is end-of-life (EOL) or end-of-support (EOS), it cannot be used for virtual server provisioning. You can deploy a virtual server from images with the following operating systems:

CentOS 7.x
Debian 10, 11
Redhat 7.x, 8.x, 9.x
Rocky Linux 8
Ubuntu 20, 22
Microsoft Windows 2016, 2019, 2022

First, go to the device menu and make sure that you have the correct account permissions to complete the tasks.

* Go to your console's device menu. For more information, see [Navigating to devices](/docs/image-templates?topic=virtual-servers-navigating-devices).
* Make sure that you have any necessary account permissions and device access. Only the account owner, or a user with the **Manage Users** classic infrastructure permission, can adjust the permissions.

For more information about permissions, see [Classic infrastructure permissions](/docs/account?topic=account-infrapermission#infrapermission) and [Managing device access](/docs/virtual-servers?topic=virtual-servers-managing-device-access).

Use the following steps to order an instance from an image template.

1. Access the **Image Templates** page by selecting **Devices > Manage > Images**.
2. Click the **Actions** menu for the image template that you want to use and select the type of virtual server that you want to order.
3. On the _Configure your Cloud Server_ page, complete all of the relevant information.
4. Click **Add to Order** to continue.
5. On the _Checkout_ page, complete any advanced system configuration.
6. Click the **Cloud Service terms** and the **Third-Party Service Agreement** check boxes.
