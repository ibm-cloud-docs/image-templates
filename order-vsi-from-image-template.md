## Before you begin
{: #byb-order-instance-imt}

First, go to the device menu and make sure that you have the correct account permissions to complete the tasks.

* Go to your console's device menu. For more information, see [Navigating to devices](/docs/image-templates?topic=virtual-servers-navigating-devices).
* Make sure that you have any necessary account permissions and device access. Only the account owner, or a user with the **Manage Users** classic infrastructure permission, can adjust the permissions.

For more information about permissions, see [Classic infrastructure permissions](/docs/account?topic=account-infrapermission#infrapermission) and [Managing device access](/docs/virtual-servers?topic=virtual-servers-managing-device-access).

Use the following steps to order an instance from an image template.

1. Access the **Image Templates** page by selecting **Devices > Manage > Images**.
2. Click the **Actions** menu for the image template that you want to use and select the type of virtual server that you want to order.
3. On the _Configure your Cloud Server_ page, complete all of the relevant information.
4. Click **Add to Order** to continue.
5. On the _Checkout_ page, complete any advanced system configuration.
6. Click the **Cloud Service terms** and the **Third-Party Service Agreement** check boxes.
7. Confirm or enter your payment information and click **Submit Order**. You are redirected to a screen with your provisioning order number. You can print the screen because it's also your provisioning order receipt.

You receive an email when your instance is provisioned.
