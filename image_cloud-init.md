# Provisioning with a cloud-init enabled image
{: #provisioning-with-a-cloud-init-enabled-image}

When you order a virtual server, many operating systems now use a cloud-init enabled image to optimize provisioning time. You can also import a customized image that you enabled for cloud-init.
{: shortdesc}

The following operating systems now default to a cloud-init enabled image when you order a virtual server without add-ons. (Add-ons include extra software, post-provisioning scripts, and advanced monitoring.)
* CentOS 7
* Debian 10, 11
* Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7.x, 8.x, 9.x
* Ubuntu 20.04, 22.04
* Windows Server 2016, 2019, 2022

When you order a virtual server with a cloud-init enabled operating system, you can add user data or metadata with custom provisioning scripts. In the User Data field on the order form, enter optional cloud-init user data or optional metadata for the server.

## Before you begin
{: #byb-cloud-init-imt}

First, go to the device menu and make sure that you have the correct account permissions to complete the tasks.

* Go to your console's device menu. For more information, see [Navigating to devices](/docs/image-templates?topic=virtual-servers-navigating-devices).
* Make sure that you have any necessary account permissions and device access. Only the account owner, or a user with the **Manage Users** classic infrastructure permission, can adjust the permissions.

For more information about permissions, see [Classic infrastructure permissions](/docs/account?topic=account-infrapermission#infrapermission) and [Managing device access](/docs/virtual-servers?topic=virtual-servers-managing-device-access).

## Import a customized cloud-init enabled image
{: #import-cloud-init-image}

If you created a customized image thatâ€™s cloud-init enabled, you can designate it as a cloud-init image on the Import Image page of
the {{site.data.keyword.slportal_full}}.

To access the Import Image page of Image Templates and mark an image as cloud-init enabled, complete the following steps:
1. From the **Devices** menu, select **Manage** > **Images**.
2. Click the **Import Image** tab.
3. Complete the required information for importing your cloud-init enabled image, and select the **Cloud-init** checkbox that is near the **Operating System** dropdown box. For more information about importing images, see [Import an Image](/docs/image-templates?topic=image-templates-preparing-and-importing-images#import-icos).

## Mark an image template as cloud-init enabled
{: #mark-image-cloud-init}

If you have an existing VHD image template that is cloud-init enabled, you can designate it as cloud-init enabled on the details page of
the image template.

To access an image template and mark it as cloud-init enabled, complete the following steps:
1. From the **Devices** menu, select **Manage** > **Images**.
2. From the list of templates, click the image template name that you want to update.
3. On the Image Template Details page, select the **Enabled** checkbox under the **Cloud-init** heading, and click **Update**.

If your image is encrypted, the **Cloud-init** checkbox is already selected by default since encrypted images must be cloud-init enabled.
{: note}

## Work with an image template that was created from a cloud-init provisioned virtual server
{: #image-template-from-cloud-init-provision}

Cloud-init typically runs only one time. However, if you provision a virtual server from a cloud-init enabled image and later create an image template from that virtual server, the UUID is recorded. If that image template is used to create another virtual server, cloud-init runs again.

## Create image templates that are cloud-init enabled
{: #create-cloud-init-templates}

For information about configuring images, see [cloud-init documentation](https://cloudinit.readthedocs.io/en/latest/){: external}.

For more information about data sources, see [Data sources](http://cloudinit.readthedocs.io/en/latest/topics/datasources.html){: external}. {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} cloud-init images are created for the environment by using the [Config Drive](https://cloudinit.readthedocs.io/en/latest/reference/datasources/configdrive.html){: external} - Version 2 data source to supply the metadata.

### Linux requirements
{: #linux-reqs-cloud-init}

Linux images that are cloud-init enabled have the following requirements:

* Cloud-init version 0.7.7 or greater is required.
* Cloud-init image is configured to use SSH for logging in to your virtual server instance.


The following example cloud.cfg file shows settings that are used in a Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 deployment. These settings differ from the default settings in the cloud-init installation package on Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7.

   ```
   # cat /etc/cloud/cloud.cfg
   # Configure the Datasource for both instances
   datasource_list: [ ConfigDrive ]
   
   user: root
   ssh_pwauth: True
   disable_root: False
   manage_etc_hosts: True
   
   system_info:
    # This will affect which distro class gets used
    distro: rhel
    # Other config here will be given to the distro class and/or path classes
    paths:
       cloud_dir: /var/lib/cloud/
       templates_dir: /etc/cloud/templates/

### Windows requirements
{: #windows-reqs-cloud-init}

* Cloudbase-init Metadata Service for public and private networks support in {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} infrastructure. The service also updates the Customer Portal with the Windows virtual server credentials. You can access the service at
[IBM Cloud-cloudbase-init](https://github.com/softlayer/bluemix-cloudbase-init){: external}.
* If you are using a Vyatta in your environment, you must configure the Vyatta to allow API calls to [API load balancers](/docs/virtual-router-appliance?topic=hardware-firewall-dedicated-ibm-cloud-ip-ranges#load-balancer-ips).
* Run the following commands to sysprep the image:
  
   ```
   C:\Program Files\Cloudbase Solutions\Cloudbase-Init\bin\SetSetupComplete.cmd
   ```
   {: pre}
 
   ```
   cd "C:\Program Files\Cloudbase Solutions\Cloudbase-Init\conf\"
   C:\Windows\System32\Sysprep\sysprep.exe /generalize /oobe /shutdown /unattend:Unattend.xml
   ```
   {: pre}
