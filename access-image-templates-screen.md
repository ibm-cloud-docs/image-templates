# Managing images from the Image Templates page

The Image Templates page in the {{site.data.keyword.slportal_full}} displays all of the images that are associated with 
an account. From the Image Templates page you can interact with those images and import new images that are stored on existing Object 
Storage accounts.

Use the following steps to access the Image Templates screen.

1. Access the [{{site.data.keyword.slportal}} ![External link icon](../../icons/launch-glyph.svg "External link icon")](https://control.softlayer.com/) by using your unique credentials.
2. Select **Devices > Manage > Images** to access the Image Templates page.

On the *Image Templates* page, you see all of the private images that are associated with the account. Any interactions with private images happen here. From this page, you can drag columns to customize the view. You can also access public images by clicking the **Private Images** drop-down selector and choosing **Public Images** instead. 

From the Image Templates page, you can order a virtual server from a standard image, delete private images, and import or export images.
