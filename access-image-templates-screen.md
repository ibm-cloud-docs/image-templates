# Managing images from the Image Templates page
{: #managing-images-from-the-image-templates-page}

The Image Templates page in the {{site.data.keyword.cloud}} console displays all of the images that are associated with
your account. From the Image Templates page, you can interact with images and import new images that are stored on existing Object Storage accounts.

## Before you begin
{: #byb-manage-imt}

First, go to the device menu and make sure that you have the correct account permissions to complete the tasks.

* Go to your console's device menu. For more information, see [Navigating to devices](/docs/virtual-servers?topic=virtual-servers-navigating-devices).
* Make sure that you have any necessary account permissions and device access. Only the account owner or a user with the **Manage Users** Classic infrastructure permission, can adjust the permissions.

For more information about permissions, see [Classic infrastructure permissions](/docs/virtual-servers?topic=virtual-servers-mngclassicinfra).

## Managing images from the Image Templates page
{: #managing-images-from-the-image-templates-page_steps}

Access the **Image Templates** page by clicking **Devices > Manage > Images**.

On the *Image Templates* page, you see all of the private images that are associated with the account. Any interactions with private images happen here. You can drag columns to customize the view. You can also access public images by clicking the **Private Images** drop-down selector and choosing **Public Images** instead.

From the Image Templates page, you can order a virtual server from a standard image, delete private images, and import or export images.
